# Understanding Clouds from Satellite Images - Planning
 
## Working cycle:
1. Read competition information and relevant content to feel comfortable with the problem. Create a hypothesis based on the problem.
2. Initial data exploration to feel comfortable with the problem and the data.
3. Build the first implementation (baseline).
4. Loop through [Analyze -> Approach(model) -> Implement -> Evaluate].

## 1. Literature review (read some kernels and relevant content related to the competition).
- ### Relevant content:
  - [Medium post about the competition](https://towardsdatascience.com/sugar-flower-fish-or-gravel-now-a-kaggle-competition-8d2b6b3b118)
  - [Paper related about the competition research](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01906.pdf)

  - [Cloud: ConvexHull& Polygon PostProcessing (No GPU)](https://www.kaggle.com/ratthachat/cloud-convexhull-polygon-postprocessing-no-gpu)
 
- ### Insights:
  - #### Positive Insights
    - For patterns like 'Sugar' or 'Gravel' its not expected any specific orientation and rotation augmentation might be applied to the images as well.
  - #### Negative Insights
    - Fish-pattern often seems to be oriented in east-west-direction (right to left).
